# **MLH Hackathons Automation**

This automation will open up the MLH home page in the Chrome browser (please make sure to install the UiPath Chrome extension) and navigate to the North America Hackathons page. The Name, URL, Dates, and Location for all of the hackathons will be scraped into a DataTable. The user will be asked to choose a folder where a .csv file that contains the scraped results will be saved. The user will be notified after the save is complete.
